PowerShell is Microsoftâ€™s next-generation scripting language and command shell.<br>
It can be used interactively, as your every day command shell, but it is also a full scripting language.<br>
By being **interactive**, PowerShell allows you to enter commands into a console and get immediate feedback. <br>
By being **scriptable**, PowerShell allows you to put all of your commands in a basic text file (with a .ps1 extension) and run them<br>

## VS Code, enable ISE Mode
ISE mode's idea is to allow users to write and debug code in a similar way they would do using the PowerShell ISE.<br>
Open the command tool using the following keyboard keys:<br>
**Ctrl + Shift + P** <br>
Search for: `Enable ISE Mode`<br>
